It would be interesting to include a section describing the general approach followed to map the different signals/variables in the OPC-UA server to Services in an Arrowhead Local cloud.

I do not know if this part needs to include details about how the OPC-UA server is configured, or is enough with the information about the services registered in the Service Registry. This last part is what I am most interested, such that an Arrowhead System can use the assembly line to manufacture a product.
